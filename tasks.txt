I need you to create a professional terraform configuration for hosting my portfolio page on github pages.

The domain to use should be example.com. there isn't anything running there at this time, meaning you can remove all records from cloudflare, except the ones for email.

The portfolio should be exposed on me.example.com, i.example.com, example.com and www.example.com

Ideally, it should be hosted by github pages or cloudflare pages, but if not, a cloud provider like aws can be used, as long as the portfolio is hosted on S3 buckets to have the lowest cost possible.

Also, the portfolio website should be protected with TLS. TLS should be handled ideally by cloudflare.

You are allowed to create a new repo on github to host this code. the repo should be private.

There should be a github action that deploys the website. You can use puppeteer to make sure everything is working properly.

Finally, the cloudflare api token you can use is: [REDACTED]. This is a privileged-limited token that only gives you access to edit cloudflare records of example.com, but it shouldn't be public.

You can use puppetter MCP to help you achieve these tasks.
